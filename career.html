## Career

My life and history to-date

I started out developing in Primary School with Basic, and moved onto Turbo Pascal 6.0 and Delphi very quickly.

I have since then developed little tools and apps that made specific tasks easier and managable.

My biggest Project is the Joker Application Framework, which is basically a PHP driven website "container" (for lack of a better word) which uses Smarty Templating engine to display content.

This has also been briefly used by a friend of mine in Germany.
